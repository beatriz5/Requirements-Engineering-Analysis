# Requirements Engineering & Analysis

Theory covered:
  * Compare and contrast the requirements analysis and specification process in the waterfall software development model vs. the Agile software development model. 
  * What are the (4-6) fundamental activities of software development (also stages of the Software Development Life Cycle) and how does each relate to requirements?
  * (REQ.rfd) What are the (4-5) fundamental requirements activities and how are they performed? (In other words, what is done during the specification / requirements stage of the software development life cycle?) (Within your answer, define a requirement and identify requirements characteristics.)
  * (REQ.er) How would you go about eliciting requirements for a software project? 
  * (REQ.rsd) What are some documents you would create or reference during the requirements engineering process? (include information about order of creation / reference, target audience, structure, key contents, and benefits)
  * (REQ.rv) How do you validate requirements? 
  * (FGCUScholars 2) What is critical thinking? How do you think critically?
