# Requirements-Engineering-Analysis
Requirements Fundamentals, Eliciting Requirements, Requirements analysis, specification and documentation, and  Practical Considerations and Software Requirements Tools Requirements validation.


1. Compare and contrast the requirements analysis and specification process in the waterfall software development model vs. the Agile software development model. 
2. What are the (4-6) fundamental activities of software development (also stages of the Software Development Life Cycle) and how does each relate to requirements?
3. (REQ.rfd) What are the (4-5) fundamental requirements activities and how are they performed? (In other words, what is done during the specification / requirements stage of the software development life cycle?) (Within your answer, define a requirement and identify requirements characteristics.)
4. (REQ.er) How would you go about eliciting requirements for a software project? 
5. (REQ.rsd) What are some documents you would create or reference during the requirements engineering process? (include information about order of creation / reference, target audience, structure, key contents, and benefits)
6. (REQ.rv) How do you validate requirements? 
7. (FGCUScholars 2) What is critical thinking? How do you think critically?
